### Designing effective LLM systems for Autonomous driving: towards a paradigm for configuring LLM based end-to-end self-driving architectures

This Work builds on the system proposed by the [LMDrive drive study](https://github.com/opendilab/LMDrive/tree/main).

This project makes 5 modifications in respect of 3 LMDrive system components: 
  1. RGB backbone encoder
  2. Lidar point cloud encoder
  3. LLM scene reasoning component

These component modifications have demonstrates promising results in testing: 



The updated code has been tested extensivley to be compatible with the CARLA simulation environment.
